		    <p class="font-project-text">I'm a viciously ambitious (and stubborn) web developer and designer.
					My passion for programming came about when I felt like a lot of websites I made use of just didn't quite help the user, which should be the goal, right? I then set forth to learn all I could about web design, development, user experience design and user interface design. This is when I discovered the Academy of Art University and how I could earn a degree completely online.
					After persueing my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Web Design and New Media at AAU, I not only learned much about web design and UI/UX, but along with all this came a lot of winding roads that led down the paths of animation, motion, video, print design, typography, and photography.</p>
        <p class="font-project-text">My goal is to start my own design/dev firm in my small town where there is a big opportunity for this line of work since it is in high demand with no supply. If that doesn't pan out, a remote, cold, very woods-y location will do. Freelancing is also one of my options, and I plans to learn as much as I can to keep up to date on all web technologies in order to provide a wide range of skills.</p>

					<div class="skills-box-text">
						I have recently taken a strong liking to user interface and experience design. Creating personas, testing, more testing, live prototyping, haviving people give feedback, talk through their process, all of it is such an insightful process and I believe each and every website or mobile/desktop app should be extensively tested and prototyped before deployment to ensure the best possible results for end-users.
